- Tables of all clustered materials, with their associated band structures, 
are found in ”all_cluster_tables”. 

- Full material data for this electronic clustering can be found in "df_fingerprints_and_final_labels.csv".

- A looser clustering solution with ~100 smaller clusters can be found in ”looser_solution_cluster_tables”.

## Notes
- all cluster tables are limited to maximum 15 materials that have the highest membership probabilities
